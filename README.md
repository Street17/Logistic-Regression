# Logistic-Regression
Hi folks,

This project is about solving a bank problem who is looking to identify the customers into two groups high net worth and low net worth. I have used logistic regression to solve this problem.

We apply logistic regression when the dependent variable is binary in nature. It is used to describe data and bringing out the relationship between a dependent binary variable and one or more than one ordinal, nominal, ratio-level and interval independent variables.

I have added all the codes and data you need to reproduce my results. 
Thanks.
